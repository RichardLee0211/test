I never thought statictical is so interesting

get a hard copy in binghamton library

I understand this in this way:
probability being zero or one is based on observed data in the past. And future
could be full of surprises. Do not say something never occur would definitely not
occur in the future. And something that always occur would definitely hold in the future.


this is clearly from a math master, I don't like to remember what's the normal distribution formula is, :(

And it tell you how to do experiments, good

and about formula, I would remember it anyway, it's not gonna change in the near future.

have to read this now, can't wait

null hypothesis: the original status, something = u_0, need to be precise
alternative hypothesis: the new method we wanna try, H_1, H_2, or H_3 is better

I think I know first part of chi-square test,
although not the chi-square statistic formula and distribution formula

ENGLISH: But, for the time being at least, we have no evidence that

possible sample size to detemine the smallest significant difference is about
two standard errors
