Ubuntu original bashrc is wrote by bashScript, learning it a little or every
time I come to here and don't know how to handle it.

```bash
    $- prints The current set of options in your current shell.
    himBH means following options are enabled:
    H - histexpand
    m - monitor
    h - hashall
    B - braceexpand
    i - interactive
```
