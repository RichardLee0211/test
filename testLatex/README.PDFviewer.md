some thoughts about pdf viewers

I view pdf a lot. Like daily job.

one kind of modes is that I need to annotation along the way.
this document I would read it again, and it is some how complicated,
such as technical report

Another kind of modes is that I just get information from pdf. like Magizines.
I would call it pure reading
I need to view pdf in a comfortable way. And I need complex pdf like magazine to render quickly
- whole page on the screen
- big enough to read the font(zoom in and zoom out at ease)
- page by page turn
- line by line turn (more likely several lines at once)
- view the table of content
- jump between pages

Another reading is that reading and copy something, like reading tutorial.
tutorial one side, and code another side
