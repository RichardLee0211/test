chapter 01 setting up openCV
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENGLISH: leverage the immense potential of OpenCV

sadly, using python2.7

Github Pages and Github Books are cool, may check them out

may check out VisualBox, VMware is the best based on web discussion

may check out MacPort

I might need to use a Linux (Ubuntu/CentOS)to do my programming work

SciPy contains some Fortran code, really??

sadly, I install python2 in my local MacOS using "brew install python2"

now, I know why I need to VM is be my test environment.
I think I am messing around my environment
```shell
    brew install python2
    pip2 install numpy
    pip2 install scipy
    brew install opencv
```
And don't update my daily working machine(namely macOS or others),
Apple would push a great system upgrade and break others' code
