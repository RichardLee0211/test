## Use Early Exits and continue to Simplify Code

## Assert Liberally
```cpp
inline Value *getOperand(unsigned I) {
    assert(I < Operands.size() && "getOperand() out of range!");
    return Operands[I];
}

```

With C++11, we can mark methods that wonâ€™t be implemented with = delete.

We prefer to put a space before an open parenthesis only in control flowstatements,
but not in normal function call expressions and function-likemacros.
For example, this is good:
```cpp
if (X) ...
for (I = 0; I != 100; ++I) ...
while (LLVMRocks) ...

somefunc(42);
assert(3 != 4 && "laws of math are failing me");
A = foo(42, 92) + bar(X);
```
