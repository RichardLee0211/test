time to start learning more
from: https://ranger.github.io/index.html

I would need to remap ALT+NUM for tab access for it conflicts with i3 config

get img preview, from: https://github.com/ranger/ranger/wiki/Image-Previews
in Debian: sudo apt install w3m-img
``` ~/.config/ranger/rc.config
set preview_images true
set preview_images_method urxvt
```

the plain screen lock program slock and i3lock

some improvement: the command line mod could auto-complete
say I have a file need to move to a directory with a long file name, I couldn't say :move this_file_name[tab] Directory_name[tab]

maybe vimiv is a good replacement for img viewer
