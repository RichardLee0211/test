This repo is essentially a playground for me.
Mainly log my journey in various tech fields.
I would try my best to keep them in order and make it easy for me to refer back.
This is not meant to be a tutorial repository although that is the direction I wanna go.

Here's some interesting ones:

| Name | Desc | Note |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| testACM | working on process, need a space for programming questions from several sources. | |
| testBashScript | Since I live a lot of my professional time in TUI and text processing is essential part, learn and use some utility is inevitable. | |
| testCpp etc. | Like C/CPP programming. while complicate, it provides unique features and functunalities, like macro, working well with assembly, could go both low level and high level. Plus some great lib and tools developed around this community. Just enjoy it. | |
