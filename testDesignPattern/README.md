## Strategy pattern:
```from wiki
In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern)
is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at
runtime. The strategy pattern
- defines a family of algorithms,
- encapsulates each algorithm, and
- makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.
```

## Observer pattern
you don't really understand the concept unless you code it
