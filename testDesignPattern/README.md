this is from youtuber Christopher Okhravi
and the book, "header first design pattern"
C++ code available in
	url = https://github.com/yaocoder/DesignPattern

motivation: I learning how to code C++ in CS540, but don't know how to do good
design of Code

## Strategy pattern:
problem it solve: inheritance and code reuse problem
a good reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strategy-pattern-set-1/
```from wiki
    In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern)
    is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at
    runtime. The strategy pattern
    - defines a family of algorithms,
    - encapsulates each algorithm, and
    - makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.
```
one thing I don't like about this code is that have to setStrategy at runtime

## Observer pattern
from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/observer-pattern-set-1-introduction/
defination:
The Observer Pattern defines a one to many dependency between objects so that
one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated
automatically.

## others
you don't really understand the concept unless you code it
want to draw UML in latex and markdown(the markdown standard doesn't support
drawing pictures. So insert pictures instead)
