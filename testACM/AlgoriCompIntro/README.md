I am back to china, and I want to finish this book for a long time
this book is call Algorithm compitition intro and recommended by a great friend Yitian Chen

I am back to china, and lose my connection to internet, need to do
- [x] buy myself a Macbook charge
- [x] get the internet connection
- [x] get a nice hair cut

# note of algorithm compitition intro
### 5.2.2 variable vector
#### problem 5-2, the block problem, Uva 101
I don't really understand the question

here, I am back 2018 fall semester, reading this book again.

# review some math here:
## appendix D: Matrices

interest topics I wanna read,
## ch13 red-black tree
this is long article and many cases
red-black properties:
    1. Every node is either red or black
    2. the root is black
    3. every leaf(NIL) is black
    4. if a node is red, then both is its children is black
    5. for each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leave contain the same number of black nodes

this is amazing how they do the rotation to keep this properties and maintain the tree
insertion and delete

AVL tree appeals in page.333

## ch28 matrix operations
TODO: how to compute A^(-1) ??
TODO: to be continue, page.821
amazing mathmatics here, this transfer for matrics
hoping I get credits from reading and understanding this, wanna have a homework here
this is a great book to read and caculate
and I head to competitive program hand book, need a question to solve
I feel like I can't do math alone, this is boring, need practical questions

## ch29 Linear programming
## ch31 Number-Theoretic Algorithm
