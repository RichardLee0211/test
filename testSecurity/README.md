for security study, I would need a virtual mechine, and it would be serveral options in macOS
- vitualBox(across platform and free)
- vmware, money and across platform
- parallels, refuse
- QEMU, open source but mainly for Linux
- boot camp, free but it's most like a dual system, refuse

I need windows because all my evil software are of window
try parallels first and download window 10 from parallel
I prefer VMware
got to have a windows running first



might try dock(the develop tools) next time

here: http://www.panduoduo.net/r/35647068
it's could be a good one for download vmware MAC and cracked

insteresting search way:
need VMware Fusion in mac,
search panduoduo and find one, need to download
search for hacking pan.baidu.com, get TamperMoney extension and script
search for downloader apps for mac, get aria2.
Aria2, This is what I wanted serverial years ago. Could be a cool software to replace Xunlei

it seems aria2 is very popular and pan.baidu.com is limited in US

this might be the first time I try to look at PE file and windows reverse engienerring
and this would begin with search, have fun
