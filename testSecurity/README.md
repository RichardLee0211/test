for security study, I would need a virtual mechine, and it would be serveral options in macOS
- vitualBox(across platform and free)
- vmware, money and across platform
- parallels, refuse
- QEMU, open source but mainly for Linux
- boot camp, free but it's most like a dual system, refuse

I need windows because all my evil software are of windows
try parallels first and download window 10 from parallel
I prefer VMware
got to have a windows running first



might try dock(the develop tools) next time

here: http://www.panduoduo.net/r/35647068
it's could be a good one for download vmware MAC and cracked

insteresting search way:
need VMware Fusion in mac,
search panduoduo and find one, need to download
search for hacking pan.baidu.com, get TamperMoney extension and script
search for downloader apps for mac, get aria2.
Aria2, This is what I wanted serverial years ago. Could be a cool software to replace Xunlei

it seems aria2 is very popular and pan.baidu.com is limited in US

download MVware Fusion 8 from here: https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?downloadGroup=FUS-8510&productId=527&download=true&fileId=167b6f633dc17a55c95d92619e7726a9&secureParam=3a79e727d026057034d66dcd6ee60b25&uuId=7230ac03-4273-4072-aba2-63bf89077263&downloadType=
and get license key from here: https://blog.csdn.net/zhao_liwei/article/details/50685889

ZY7TK-A3D4N-08EUZ-TQN5E-XG2TF
FG1MA-25Y1J-H857P-6MZZE-YZAZ6
and may could get VMware from here: http://www.orsoon.com/news/174624.html
bother about it later
and one post save me, here: http://planetvm.net/blog/?p=3240
system preference->securityandPrivate->allow the block message



this might be the first time I try to look at PE file and windows reverse engienerring
and this would begin with search, have fun
https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/37921/windows-pe-file-and-malwares
and MSDN documentary in PE format
here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680547(v=vs.85).aspx

Portable Executable(PE) and Common Object File Format(COFF)

since I have install MVware and would need system ISO file, here's usually hacking linux distro
https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/top-10-linux-distro-ethical-hacking-penetration-testing/#gref

install Kali with root abcd
