GNU C Library may have more implement and useful stuff

# 2 error report
errno.h
well, it's GNU C, macOS is BSD linux
program_invocation_short_name is a GNU extension
```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
        FILE *
    open_sesame (char *name)
    {
        FILE *stream;
        errno = 0;
        stream = fopen (name, "r");
        if (stream == NULL)
        {
            fprintf (stderr, "%s: Couldn't open file %s; %s\n",
                    program_invocation_short_name, name, strerror (errno));
            exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
        else
            return stream;
    }
    int main(){
        open_sesame("test1.c");
    }
```
```bash
a.out: Couldn't open file test1.c; No such file or directory
```
